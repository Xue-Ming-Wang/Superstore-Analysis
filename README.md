# Superstore Sales & Customer Behavior Analysis

This project analyzes a Superstore's sales and profit trends from 2014 to 2017, leveraging transactional data to uncover key business insights. The study reveals annual growth in sales but identifies discounts as a critical factor impacting profitability, with excessive discounts (>20%) leading to losses. Seasonal trends show higher sales in the second half of the year, driven by repeat customers. Cross-category shopping behavior highlights the office supplies category as the most profitable, while furniture and technology serve as entry points for customer retention. Advanced segmentation techniques like RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis classify customers into actionable groups, recommending tailored strategies such as targeted discounts or re-engagement campaigns. The findings emphasize optimizing discount policies and leveraging cross-selling opportunities to enhance profitability and customer loyalty.
